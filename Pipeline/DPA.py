class DensityPeakAdvanced(ClusterMixin, BaseEstimator): 
    """Class definition for the non-parametric Density Peak clustering.

    The default pipeline makes use of the `PAk` density estimator and of the `TWO-NN` intristic dimension estimator.
    The densities and the corresponding errors can also be provided as precomputed arrays.
 
    Parameters
    ----------

    Z : float, default = 1
        The number of standard deviations, which fixes the level of statistical confidence at which 
        one decides to consider a cluster meaningful.

    metric : string, or callable
        The distance metric to use. 
        If metric is a string, it must be one of the options allowed by 
        scipy.spatial.distance.pdist for its metric parameter, or a metric listed in 
        :obj:`VALID_METRIC = [precomputed, euclidean,cosine]`. If metric is ``precomputed``, X is assumed to
        be a distance matrix. Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is 
        called on each pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The 
        callable should take two arrays from X as input and return a value indicating 
        the distance between them. Default is ``euclidean``.

    densities : array [n_samples], default = None
        The logarithm of the density at each point. If provided, the following parameters are ignored:
        ``density_algo``, ``k_max``, ``D_thr``.

    err_densities : array [n_samples], default = None
        The uncertainty in the density estimation, obtained by computing 
        the inverse of the Fisher information matrix.

    k_hat : array [n_samples], default = None
        The optimal number of neighbors for which the condition of constant density holds.

    nn_distances  : array [n_samples, k_max+1]
        Distances to the k_max neighbors of each points.

    nn_indices : array [n_samples, k_max+1]
        Indices of the k_max neighbors of each points.

    affinity : string or callable, default 'precomputed'
        How to construct the affinity matrix.
         - ``nearest_neighbors`` : construct the affinity matrix by computing a
           graph of nearest neighbors.
         - ``rbf`` : construct the affinity matrix using a radial basis function
           (RBF) kernel.
         - ``precomputed`` : interpret ``X`` as a precomputed affinity matrix.
         - ``precomputed_nearest_neighbors`` : interpret ``X`` as a sparse graph
           of precomputed nearest neighbors, and constructs the affinity matrix
           by selecting the ``n_neighbors`` nearest neighbors.
         - one of the kernels supported by
           :func:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_kernels`.

    density_algo : string, default = "PAk"
        Define the algorithm to use as density estimator. It mast be one of the options allowed by 
        :obj:`VALID_DENSITY = [PAk, kNN]`. 
        
    k_max : int, default=1000
        This parameter is considered if density_algo is ``PAk`` or ``kNN``, it is ignored otherwise.
        k_max set the maximum number of nearest-neighbors considered by the density estimator.
        If ``density_algo=PAk``, k_max is used by the algorithm in the search for the 
        largest number of neighbors ``k_hat`` for which the condition of constant density 
        holds, within a given level of confidence. 
        If ``density_algo=kNN``, k_max set the number of neighbors to be used by the standard
        k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
        If the number of points in the sample N is 
        less than the default value, k_max will be set automatically to the value ``N/2``.

    D_thr : float, default=23.92812698
        This parameter is considered if density_algo is ``PAk``, it is ignored otherwise.
        Set the level of confidence in the PAk density estimator. The default value corresponds to a p-value of 
        :math:`10^{-6}` for a :math:`\chiˆ2` distribution with one degree of freedom.

    dim : int, default = None
        Intrinsic dimensionality of the sample. If dim is provided, the following parameters are ignored:
        ``dim_algo``, ``blockAn``, ``block_ratio``, ``frac``.

    dim_algo : string, or callable, default="twoNN"
        Method for intrinsic dimensionality calculation. If dim_algo is ``auto``, dim is assumed to be
        equal to n_samples. If dim_algo is a string, it must be one of the options allowed by :obj:`VALID_DIM = [auto, twoNN]`. 

    blockAn : bool, default=True
        This parameter is considered if dim_algo is ``twoNN``, it is ignored otherwise.
        If blockAn is True the algorithm perform a block analysis that allows discriminating the relevant dimensions 
        as a function of the block size. This allows to study the stability of the estimation with respect to
        changes in the neighborhood size, which is crucial for ID estimations when the data lie on a 
        manifold perturbed by a high-dimensional noise. 

    block_ratio : int, default=5
        This parameter is considered if dim_algo is ``twoNN``, it is ignored otherwise.
        Set the minimum size of the blocks as `n_samples/block_ratio`. If ``blockAn=False``, ``block_ratio`` is ignored.

    frac : float, default=1
        This parameter is considered if dim_algo is ``twoNN``, it is ignored otherwise.
        Define the fraction of points in the data set used for ID calculation. By default the full data set is used.   

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by computing
        each of the n_init runs in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    labels_ : array [Nclus]
        The clustering labels assigned to each point in the data set.

    halos_ : array [Nclus]
        The clustering labels assigned to each point in the data set. Points identified as halos have 
        label equal to zero.

    topography_ : array [Nclus, Nclus]
        Let be Nclus the number of clusters, the topography consists in a Nclus × Nclus symmetric matrix, 
        in which the diagonal entries are the heights of the peaks and the off-diagonal entries are the 
        heights of the saddle points. 

    distances_ : array [n_samples, k_max+1]
        Distances to the k_max neighbors of each points. The point itself is included in the array.

    indices_ : array [n_samples, k_max+1]
        Indices of the k_max neighbors of each points. The point itself is included in the array.
 
    k_hat_ : array [n_samples]
        The optimal number of neighbors for which the condition of constant density holds.

    centers_ :array [Nclus]
        The clustering labels assigned to each point in the data set.

    dim_ : int, 
        Intrinsic dimensionality of the sample. If ``dim`` is not provided, ``dim_`` is set 
        to the number of features in the input file.

    k_max_ : int
        The maximum number of nearest-neighbors considered by the procedure that returns the
        largest number of neighbors ``k_hat`` for which the condition of constant density
        holds, within a given level of confidence. If the number of points in the sample `N` is
        less than the default value, k_max_ will be set automatically to the value ``N/2``.

    densities_ : array [n_samples]
        If not provided by the parameter ``densities``, it is computed by using the `PAk` density estimator. 

    err_densities_ : array [n_samples]
        The uncertainty in the density estimation. If not provided by the parameter ``densities``, it is 
        computed by using the `PAk` density estimator.
